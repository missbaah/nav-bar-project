## Task

The task of this project was to create the functionality for toggle navbar using JS.

## What I learned

In this project, I learn about the method **.classList** which returns the a live list of class names attached to an HTML element. This method has sub methods which allows the live list returned to be manipulated.
**.contain()** - returns true or false if the class list contains the given class name
**.add()** - adds a new class name to the list
**.remove()** - removes the class name
**.toggle()** - switches between adding and removing the given class name.

## Error lessons

I added an event listener to a variable that store the value of document.getElementByClassName(). Learnt about how event listeners are only added to HTML elements and not HTML collections or arrays.
